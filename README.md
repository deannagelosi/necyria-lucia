# Necyria lucia

*Necyria lucia* is a second piece in a series of interactive taxidermy insects. The metalmark butterfly animates when a viewer trouches its frame. A capacitive touch sensor activates a stepper motor that drives the fluttering mechanism.

In 2021, the piece was part of The Box Show at [Gallery Route One](https://galleryrouteone.org/) in Point Reyes Station, California. It was exhibited from August to September, and proceeds from the purchase were contributed to the gallery's annual fundraiser.
